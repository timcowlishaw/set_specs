set_specs - A few useful RSpec matchers for making assertions about enumerables.
================================================================================

Consists of:
* intersects_with - asserts that one enumerable intersects with another
* be_a_subset_of - asserts that one enumerable is a subset of another
* be_a_proper_subset_of - asserts that one enumerable is a proper subset of another (ie, the two are not equivalent)

Installation: gem install set_specs

Enjoy!
